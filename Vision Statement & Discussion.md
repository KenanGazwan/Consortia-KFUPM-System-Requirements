**Vision Statement**
For KFUPM and its industry partners, who need to arrange and secure an efficient way to manage research and development consortia, the Consortia Management System (CMS) is a worldwide approach for collaborative research involving academic institutions, industries, and multiple stakeholders that enables streamlined communication, agreement processing, and project tracking offering a centralized, role-based access control system with robust tracking, version control, and resource sharing capabilities, ensuring transparency, accountability, and enhanced collaboration among all stakeholders. Unlike the current manual and email-based processes that are prone to errors and inefficiencies, our system is designed to integrate with KFUPM's existing technological infrastructure, and provide an interface that minimizes the need for training. By automating notifications and approvals, and providing a dashboard for real-time status updates for tracking, the CMS will empower users to complete tasks effectively.

**Discussion**
The process of gathering and brainstorming requirements for the Consortia Management System involved a collaborative effort among team members. Initially, each member individually brainstormed and noted down various requirements based on their understanding of the project objectives and stakeholdersâ€™ needs from the provided description and the recorded meeting. Subsequently, we met on Microsoft Teams to discuss and combine the gathered requirements, ensuring clarity and coherence. Through this discussion, redundancies were identified and resolved, ensuring that each requirement contributed uniquely to the system's functionality. Moreover, we collectively classified the requirements based on their priority, distinguishing between Functional Requirements (FR) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR). Within the NFR category, we further categorized requirements based on their type, such as security, usability, performance, and reliability. Additionally, we discussed the specific cases each requirement addressed and determined the quality type it represented, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the system's objectives and constraints. This collaborative approach facilitated the development of a robust and well-rounded set of requirements that aligns effectively with the project's goals and stakeholder expectations.
